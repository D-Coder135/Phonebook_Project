# Phonebook Application(Web-App)☎️📶📞

## My Goal

The objective of this project was to build a web application known as Phonebook application, which is developed using Java MVC, Servlets and JSP. The application contains register/login validations. It uses an online local database known as h2 Database engine for authenticating its users and storing the data for each user respectively. As the name of the app suggests, a user can maintain his/her own contact list. The end-user can add new contact details, view all saved contacts, edit already saved contacts as well as delete saved contacts. Also the application contains different kinds of themes which the end-user can change dynamically using separate buttons, hence providing a beautiful user interface.
